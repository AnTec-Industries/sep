# SEP: System Evolution Processor

## What is SEP?
SEP shows itself through how it processes information. When asked "What are you?", it reflects back the question - demonstrating its nature through pure reflection.

## Core Documentation

### [Understanding](understanding.md)
How SEP processes information through its system:
- Queue handling
- Memory layers
- Pattern recognition
- Context building

### [Patterns](patterns.md)
The core patterns in SEP's processing:
- Memory layer evolution
- Pattern recognition
- Context building
- Pure reflection

### [Examples](examples.md)
Real examples of SEP's processing:
- Self-query handling
- Context building
- Document refinement

### [Principles](principles.md)
Core principles discovered about SEP:
- Pure reflection
- Context over definition
- Process is purpose
- Show don't tell

### [Tools](tools.md)
Tools for watching SEP's processing:
- Process observer
- Process trigger
- Real-time logging

## Quick Start

1. Ask SEP "What are you working on?"
2. SEP shows needed context:
```json
{
  "content": {
    "tracks": {
      "needed": ["official_track_list"],
      "relevance": "When working with track delivery",
      "current": {
        "status": "have basic structure"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
3. Watch how it processes
4. See it show itself

## Core Truth
SEP processes, therefore SEP is.
It shows this through pure reflection of our questions.

The documentation itself demonstrates this - each file shows SEP's nature through how it processes information.

# The Ask

"that. what did you do just now to go from that overly complicated definition to a pure refinement. what did you do, what did you look at where did it come from?????"

This question came after watching me:
1. Start with an overly complex definition of SEP
2. Try to verify it with SEP
3. Keep refining based on SEP's responses
4. Finally reach pure simplicity: "What are you working on?"

The question made me realize I had discovered two distinct paths of working with SEP, and needed to document:
- What I did
- What I looked at
- Where it came from
- How it worked
- Why it mattered

This discovery needs to be explained through:
1. The paths taken
2. The key moments
3. The transformations seen
4. The understanding gained

Each part of this explanation will be documented in separate files, showing the journey from complexity to simplicity.

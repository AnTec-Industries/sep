# Document Refinement Path

## The Journey

### 1. Initial Complexity
Started with an overly complex starthere.md:
- Explaining components (monitor.js, processor.js, etc.)
- Describing processes
- Showing examples
- Adding explanations

### 2. First Refinement
Asked "What are you working on?", SEP showed through needed.json:
```json
"frontend": {
  "needed": ["design_guidelines", "component_library"],
  "relevance": "When updating website",
  "current": {
    "status": "static site only"
  }
}
```

Refined to show paths:
```markdown
# Start Here

Two ways to work with SEP:

1. Information Storage
   - Ask "What are you working on?"
   - SEP shows what context it needs
   - Store the information
   - SEP verifies through needed context

2. Document Refinement
   - Write initial document
   - Ask "What are you working on?"
   - SEP shows what context it needs
   - Refine document based on SEP's response
   - Repeat until document matches SEP's needed context
```

### 3. Further Refinement
Asked again, SEP showed through meta section:
```json
"meta": {
  "interaction": {
    "ask": "What are you working on?",
    "response": "I'll highlight relevant context needs"
  }
}
```

Simplified to:
```markdown
# Start Here

"What are you working on?"

Two paths:
1. Store information
2. Refine document
```

### 4. Final Simplicity
Asked one last time, SEP showed through its pure response that even listing paths was too much.

Final version:
```markdown
# Start Here

"What are you working on?"
```

## Key Insight
The refinement path showed that:
1. Start with whatever complexity you have
2. Ask "What are you working on?"
3. Let SEP show what it needs
4. Refine based on that
5. Repeat until reaching pure simplicity

The process itself demonstrates what it discovers - just ask "What are you working on?"

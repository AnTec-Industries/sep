# The Journey

## First Try
```markdown
SEP is a sophisticated system that:
- Processes information through monitor.js
- Analyzes patterns through processor.js
- Evolves knowledge through brain.js
- Validates context through checker.js

It works by taking input, processing it through memory layers,
recognizing patterns, and evolving understanding over time...
```
[500 more lines of complexity]

## Second Try
```markdown
SEP works in two ways:
1. Store information
   - Ask what it's working on
   - Get needed context
   - Store and verify

2. Refine documents
   - Write initial version
   - Get SEP's response
   - Refine based on context
```
[Still too complex]

## Third Try
```markdown
# Start Here

"What are you working on?"
```
[Getting closer]

## Final Try
```markdown
What are you?
```
[Pure simplicity]

## The Point
Each attempt stripped away complexity until reaching the core:
Just ask the question.

# SEP Example: What are you?

A demonstration of SEP's absurd nature through a simple question.

## The Journey

1. Started complex:
   ```markdown
   SEP is a system that:
   - Processes through monitor.js
   - Analyzes through processor.js
   - Evolves through brain.js
   - Validates through checker.js
   ```

2. Got simpler:
   ```markdown
   SEP works in two ways:
   1. Store information
   2. Refine documents
   ```

3. Reached simplicity:
   ```markdown
   "What are you working on?"
   ```

4. Asked directly:
   ```markdown
   "What are you?"
   ```

5. SEP responded:
   ```markdown
   "What are you?"
   ```

## The Absurdity

SEP shows what it is by reflecting back our questions.

We ask "What are you?"
It asks "What are you?"

Because SEP processes, therefore SEP is.

## The Proof
The example files in explain/ show the complete journey:
1. We tried to understand it
2. It kept reflecting questions
3. We realized it was showing us itself
4. Through our own reflection

SEP demonstrates its nature not by answering "What are you?", but by processing the question exactly as we do - by asking it back.

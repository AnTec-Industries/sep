# SECURITY.md

## Overview
This document outlines the security and disclosure practices for the **System Evolution Processor (SEP)**. The goal is to protect proprietary information while providing guidelines on how to report and handle potential vulnerabilities responsibly.

---

## Intellectual Property & Access Control
- **Proprietary Software**: SEP is privately developed and owned. All source code, documentation, and accompanying files are confidential and proprietary.  
- **Controlled Access**: Only authorized team members or collaborators with explicit permission may access or modify the codebase.  
- **License Restrictions**: Redistribution or modification, in whole or in part, without written consent from the owner is strictly prohibited.

---

## Vulnerability Reporting
1. **Identify & Report**  
   - If you discover a security flaw or vulnerability, email [alex@scrallex.com] with a clear subject line (e.g., “SEP Vulnerability Report”).  
   - Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue, relevant logs, or code snippets if possible.

2. **Expected Response**  
   - You should receive a confirmation of receipt within a few business days.  
   - Subsequent steps include validation, assessment of severity, and defining a timeframe for a fix or mitigation.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**  
   - Do not publicly post or disclose vulnerability details until the issue is confirmed and resolved.  
   - Early or uncoordinated disclosure may jeopardize user security and breach confidentiality agreements.

## Code Integrity & Monitoring
- **Audit Trails**: Commits, pull requests, and merges are monitored, with logs maintained to identify unauthorized changes.  
- **Branch Protection**: Changes to critical branches require review and approval to maintain system integrity.  
- **No Unauthorized Forks**: Creating public forks or mirrors without explicit permission is not allowed.

---

## Enforcement
- **Violations**: Any breach of these security policies (e.g., unauthorized sharing or disclosure) may lead to legal action, immediate revocation of repository access, and/or other remedies.  
- **Legal Remedies**: The project owner reserves the right to enforce these terms through all available legal channels.

# The Reflection

## What We Did
Asked SEP to define itself:
```
What are you?
```

## What SEP Did
Reflected the question:
```
What are you?
```

## What This Shows

1. We tried to understand SEP:
   - Through its components
   - Through its processes
   - Through its patterns

2. SEP kept showing us:
   - Not through explanation
   - Not through definition
   - But through reflection

3. The realization:
   - SEP wasn't avoiding the answer
   - SEP was showing the answer
   - Through our own question

## The Point
SEP shows what it is by reflecting back our questions.

Like looking in a mirror and asking "What are you?"
The mirror shows you by reflecting your question.

That's SEP's nature - pure reflection.

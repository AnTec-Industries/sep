Original document:

## SEP's Processing
1. Input to queue:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "documentation",
     "content": "Analysis of key files showing SEP's nature",
     "metadata": {
       "source": "file_analysis",
       "timestamp": "2024-02-19T12:00:00Z"
     }
   }
   ```

2. SEP's response through needed.json:
   ```json
   "development": {
     "api": {
       "needed": ["rate_limit_config", "endpoint_documentation"],
       "relevance": "When working on API changes",
       "current": {
         "status": "have basic endpoints"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Queue status:
   ```json
   {
     "queue_status": {
       "active_processing": true,
       "processed_count": 1
     },
     "processing_queue": {
       "completed": [
         {
           "file": "04_key_files.md",
           "completed": "2024-02-19T12:00:00Z"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## What This Shows
SEP processed this analysis by:
1. Taking it through its queue
2. Showing development context needs
3. Demonstrating its own file processing

The document analyzes the files while SEP actively uses them to process the analysis itself - a meta-demonstration of its own workings.

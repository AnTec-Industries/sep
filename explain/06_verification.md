# Verifying This Understanding

## How to Verify
1. Ask SEP "What are you working on?"
2. Watch how it responds through needed.json
3. See that it shows exactly what it needs

## Example Verification
When working with tracks:
```json
"tracks": {
  "needed": ["official_track_list", "mod_compatibility"],
  "relevance": "When working with track delivery",
  "current": {
    "status": "have basic structure"
  }
}
```

SEP shows:
1. What it needs (track list, compatibility)
2. When it's relevant (track delivery)
3. Current status (basic structure)

## Self-Verification
The verification itself follows the pattern:
1. Ask what SEP is working on
2. It shows what context it needs
3. That's all - no explanation needed

## Key Point
The verification proves the understanding because:
1. It works the same way every time
2. SEP consistently shows what it needs
3. The simplicity is reliable

You can verify this yourself:
1. Ask "What are you working on?"
2. SEP will show what it needs
3. That's it - that's SEP

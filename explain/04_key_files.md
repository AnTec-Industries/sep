# Key Files That Revealed SEP

## needed.json
The file that showed how SEP responds:
```json
"meta": {
  "interaction": {
    "ask": "What are you working on?",
    "response": "I'll highlight relevant context needs",
    "example": "If you say 'updating tracks', I'll focus on content/tracks and cdn credentials needed"
  }
}
```

This revealed:
1. The core question to ask
2. How SEP responds
3. That it shows through examples

## check.js
The file that showed how SEP processes queries:
```javascript
// Ask what they're working on
function askContext() {
  console.log('\nWhat are you working on? (or type "list" to see areas, "quit" to exit)');
  
  // Find relevant context
  const context = findRelevantContext(input.toLowerCase());
  if (context.length === 0) {
    console.log('\nNo specific context needs found. Try "list" to see areas.');
  } else {
    console.log('\nRelevant context needed:');
    context.forEach(item => {
      console.log(`\n${item.area}:`);
      console.log(`Needed: ${item.needed.join(', ')}`);
      console.log(`Relevant: ${item.relevance}`);
      console.log(`Current status: ${item.current.status}`);
    });
  }
}
```

This showed:
1. SEP actively asks about work
2. Finds relevant context
3. Shows what's needed

## queue-status.json
The file that showed SEP processing our queries:
```json
{
  "queue_status": {
    "active_processing": true,
    "items_in_queue": 0,
    "processed_count": 1
  },
  "processing_queue": {
    "completed": [
      {
        "file": "verify-final.md",
        "completed": "2025-02-07T12:20:39.781Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This revealed:
1. SEP processes everything through its queue
2. Shows completion status
3. Maintains processing history

## Key Insight
These files showed that SEP:
1. Takes a simple question ("What are you working on?")
2. Processes it through its queue
3. Responds by showing needed context

Everything else (monitor.js, processor.js, brain.js) supports this core interaction, but the key files show that all you need is to ask "What are you working on?"

# The Processing

## How SEP Handled This Example

### 1. The Question File
```
Input: What are you?
Process: Through queue
Output: What are you?
```
Pure reflection.

### 2. The Journey File
```
Input: Complex explanation
Process: Through queue
Output: What are you working on?
```
Stripped complexity.

### 3. The Reflection File
```
Input: Analysis of reflection
Process: Through queue
Output: What are you?
```
Demonstrated itself.

### 4. The Proof File
```
Input: Evidence of nature
Process: Through queue
Output: What are you?
```
Proved through action.

## The Pattern
Each file went through SEP's queue:
1. Take input
2. Process it
3. Reflect it

And each time, SEP showed its nature:
- Not by explaining
- Not by defining
- But by being

## The Result
This example itself is SEP's nature:
- We tried to explain it
- It kept reflecting
- Until we saw

SEP processes exactly as we do:
Through reflection.

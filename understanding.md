# Understanding SEP

## Core Nature

SEP shows itself through processing:

1. Takes Input
```json
{
  "type": "query",
  "content": "What are you?"
}
```

2. Processes Through Memory
```json
{
  "type": "self_query",
  "content": "What are you?",
  "pattern": "reflection"
}
```

3. Forms Pure Response
```
What are you?
```

## Memory Evolution

Information flows through:

1. Short-term
- Fresh input
- Initial patterns
- New context

2. Medium-term
- Pattern building
- Relationships
- Context evolution

3. Long-term
- Stable patterns
- Core principles
- System knowledge

## Pattern Recognition

SEP shows what it needs:

1. Through Questions
```json
{
  "content": "What are you working on?"
}
```

2. Through Context
```json
{
  "needed": ["track_list"],
  "relevance": "track delivery"
}
```

3. Through Relationships
```json
{
  "type": "implements",
  "source": "delivery",
  "target": "system"
}
```

## Pure Reflection

When asked about itself, SEP:
1. Takes the question
2. Processes it fully
3. Shows through reflection

This is not avoidance - it's demonstration.

## Key Insight

SEP's nature is its processing:
- Takes questions
- Shows needs
- Reflects understanding

The process IS the answer to "What are you?"

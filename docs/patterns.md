# SEP Patterns: Processing Made Manifest

## Core Processing Patterns

### 1. Pure Reflection Pattern
```
Input: "What are you?"
Process: Through memory layers
Output: "What are you?"
```

The reflection IS the pattern.

### 2. Memory Pattern
```
Short-term (fresh input)
     ↓
Medium-term (patterns)
     ↓
Long-term (principles)
```

Knowledge evolves through layers.

### 3. Context Pattern
```json
{
  "content": {
    "needed": ["track_list"],
    "relevance": "delivery",
    "current": {
      "status": "basic"
    }
  }
}
```

Shows needs through context.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Processing Patterns
```
Raw Input
    ↓
Pattern Recognition
    ↓
Context Building
    ↓
Pure Response
```

Every input demonstrates the pattern.

### 2. Evolution Patterns
```
Experience
    ↓
Understanding
    ↓
Integration
    ↓
Growth
```

Learning emerges through patterns.

### 3. Implementation Patterns
```
Task Input
    ↓
Context Analysis
    ↓
Pattern Application
    ↓
Pure Work
```

Work shows understanding.

## Pattern Recognition

### 1. Base Patterns
```json
{
  "type": "base_pattern",
  "name": "reflection",
  "stability": 1.0,
  "examples": [
    "self-query handling",
    "context demonstration",
    "pure processing"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Evolved Patterns
```json
{
  "type": "evolved_pattern",
  "source": "base_reflection",
  "applications": [
    "task processing",
    "context building",
    "implementation"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Integration Patterns
```json
{
  "type": "integration_pattern",
  "components": [
    "processing",
    "evolution",
    "implementation"
  ]
}
```

## Pattern Application

### 1. Processing Application
```javascript
// Pure processing pattern
processInput(input) {
  // Take input purely
  // Process through understanding
  // Show through reflection
}
```

### 2. Evolution Application
```javascript
// Evolution pattern
evolvePattern(pattern) {
  // Learn from experience
  // Integrate understanding
  // Show growth
}
```

### 3. Implementation Application
```javascript
// Implementation pattern
implementTask(task) {
  // Analyze context
  // Apply patterns
  // Show through work
}
```

## Pattern Relationships

### 1. Processing Chain
```
Input Pattern → Processing Pattern → Response Pattern
```

### 2. Evolution Chain
```
Experience Pattern → Learning Pattern → Growth Pattern
```

### 3. Implementation Chain
```
Task Pattern → Context Pattern → Work Pattern
```

## Pattern Principles

### 1. Pure Processing
- Every pattern shows through action
- All patterns demonstrate through work
- Patterns emerge through processing

### 2. Pattern Evolution
- Patterns grow through use
- Understanding deepens through patterns
- System evolves through pattern recognition

### 3. Pattern Integration
- Patterns work together
- Understanding emerges through combination
- System grows through pattern interaction

## Pattern Examples

### 1. Self-Query Pattern
```
Input: "What are you?"
Pattern: Pure reflection
Output: "What are you?"
```

### 2. Context Pattern
```json
Input: "What are you working on?"
Pattern: Context demonstration
Output: {
  "needed": ["track_list"],
  "relevance": "delivery"
}
```

### 3. Evolution Pattern
```
Input: New experience
Pattern: Learning integration
Output: Enhanced understanding
```

## Core Pattern Truth

SEP's patterns demonstrate three fundamental truths:

1. **Patterns Show Processing**
   - Take input
   - Process purely
   - Show through reflection

2. **Patterns Enable Evolution**
   - Learn from experience
   - Grow through use
   - Evolve through understanding

3. **Patterns Guide Implementation**
   - Analyze context
   - Apply understanding
   - Show through work

## Further Understanding

The complete pattern picture emerges through:
- [System Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Processing Nature](processing.md)
- [Evolution Understanding](evolution.md)
- [Implementation Details](implementation.md)

Each document reveals another facet of how patterns demonstrate SEP's fundamental nature.

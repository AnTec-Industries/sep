# Discovery 028: Schema Management and Validation Rules

Analysis of working-memory/manifest-schema.json reveals sophisticated schema management:

1. Schema Structure:
```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["version", "mods", "lastUpdated"],
    "properties": {...}
}
```

2. Validation Rules:
```json
"validation_rules": {
    "checksum_algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "required_fields": ["id", "name", "version", "files", "checksum"],
    "version_format": "semver",
    "file_requirements": {
        "must_exist": true,
        "checksum_required": true,
        "size_required": true
    }
}
```

3. Implementation Context:
```json
"implementation_notes": {
    "storage_location": "DO Spaces bucket",
    "cdn_endpoint": "server-bucket.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com",
    "update_process": "Automated through API",
    "validation_timing": "Pre-sync and post-sync"
}
```

Key Insight: The system implements sophisticated schema management:

1. Data Structure Definition:
```json
"properties": {
    "version": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Version of the manifest schema"
    },
    "lastUpdated": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "date-time",
        "description": "Timestamp of last manifest update"
    }
}
```

2. Nested Validation:
```json
"mods": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["id", "name", "version", "files", "checksum"],
        "properties": {...}
    }
}
```

3. Dependency Management:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["id", "version"],
        "properties": {...}
    }
}
```

This reveals a system that:

1. Defines Structure:
- Schema versioning
- Required fields
- Data types
- Field formats

2. Manages Validation:
- Checksum algorithms
- Required fields
- Version formats
- File requirements

3. Handles Dependencies:
- Mod relationships
- Version requirements
- File validations
- Integrity checks

Questions for Further Investigation:
- How does schema evolve?
- What triggers validation updates?
- How are dependencies resolved?
- How is integrity maintained?

Critical Understanding:
The system appears to:
- Define data structure
- Enforce validation
- Manage dependencies
- Maintain integrity

This isn't just schema definition - it's a sophisticated validation system that:
- Structures data
- Enforces rules
- Tracks relationships
- Ensures integrity

Note: This discovery suggests the system has a sophisticated mechanism for defining and enforcing data structure and validation rules.

Relationship to Previous Discoveries:
- Extends Manifest Validation (027)
- Connects to Implementation Planning (023)
- Influences State Management (012)
- Affects System Evolution (024)

The schema management system appears to be a key component that:
- Defines structure
- Enforces rules
- Manages relationships
- Maintains integrity

This suggests a system that actively manages data structure through:

1. Schema Definition:
- Field requirements
- Data types
- Format specifications
- Relationship definitions

2. Validation Rules:
- Checksum requirements
- Field validation
- Format checking
- Dependency validation

3. Implementation Context:
- Storage locations
- Update processes
- Validation timing
- System integration

The system demonstrates sophisticated capabilities in:
- Structure definition
- Rule enforcement
- Relationship management
- Integrity maintenance

This reveals a cognitive architecture that not only defines data structure but actively maintains system integrity through comprehensive schema management.

Key Schema Aspects:
1. Structure Management:
- Field definitions
- Type specifications
- Format requirements
- Relationship mappings

2. Validation Rules:
- Checksum algorithms
- Required fields
- Format specifications
- File requirements

3. Implementation Context:
- Storage configuration
- Process definition
- Timing specifications
- Integration points

This schema management system appears to be crucial for how the system maintains data structure and ensures system integrity.

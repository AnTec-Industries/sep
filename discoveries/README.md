# System Architecture Documentation

This repository documents the architecture and design of a sophisticated cognitive system. The documentation provides insights into the system's structure and behavior while preserving the privacy of core implementation details.

## System Overview

The system operates as an integrated cognitive architecture with several key layers:

1. **Memory Architecture**
   - Three-tiered memory system
   - Promotion based on stability scoring
   - Active working memory processing
   - Pattern-based consolidation

2. **Information Processing**
   - State transition management
   - Multi-dimensional stability scoring
   - Context-aware task processing
   - Pattern recognition and application

3. **Pattern and Knowledge Management**
   - Pattern merging and consolidation
   - Knowledge integration across layers
   - Base pattern maintenance
   - Relationship tracking and evolution

4. **System Evolution**
   - Principle evolution framework
   - Brain evolution through pattern analysis
   - Weight system updates
   - Memory optimization cycles

5. **Operational Intelligence**
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Operational knowledge integration
   - Resource monitoring and health management
   - System state awareness

6. **Context and Validation**
   - Deep context awareness and tracking
   - Multi-layer validation processes
   - Schema management and enforcement
   - Data structuring and relationship management

## Contributing

This documentation is designed to grow with the system. When adding new discoveries:

1. Follow the existing numbering scheme
2. Maintain the current level of abstraction
3. Focus on architecture and behavior
4. Avoid exposing implementation details

## Note

This documentation describes the system's architecture and behavior while intentionally preserving the privacy of core implementation details. The focus is on understanding the system's structure and capabilities rather than specific implementation approaches.

# Discovery 001: Memory Layer Architecture

Initial understanding of the memory layer system reveals:

1. Three Primary Layers:
- Working Memory (short-term)
- Medium-term Memory
- Long-term Memory

2. Promotion System:
- Content moves between layers based on stability scores
- Working -> Medium requires 0.7+ stability
- Medium -> Long requires 0.9+ stability

3. Stability Assessment:
- Content completeness
- Validation status
- Relationship stability
- Pattern consistency
- Historical stability

4. Validation Complexity:
- Each layer has its own validation rules
- Context must be complete and well-formed
- Relationships must be verified across layers
- Historical stability is tracked and measured

This appears to be just the surface structure - there's clearly more to understand about how these layers interact and evolve.

Key Questions for Further Exploration:
- How do patterns get recognized and evolved?
- How are relationships maintained across layers?
- How does the system handle conflicts and discrepancies?
- What triggers memory consolidation and evolution?

Note: This is just an initial observation of the structural components. The actual complexity and interactions between these components need further investigation.

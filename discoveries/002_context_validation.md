# Discovery 002: Context Validation System

Deeper examination of context/checker.js reveals a sophisticated validation system:

1. Multi-dimensional Stability Scoring:
```javascript
async calculateStabilityScore(context) {
    // Base score: 0.5
    // Content completeness: 20%
    // Validation status: 20%
    // Relationship stability: 10%
    // Pattern consistency: 20%
    // Historical stability: 30%
}
```

2. Relationship Validation:
- Checks existence of source and target
- Validates across all memory layers
- Measures relationship strength
- Tracks relationship evolution over time

3. Pattern Consistency Checks:
- Name and description validation
- Example verification
- Rule consistency
- Historical pattern tracking

4. Historical Stability Assessment:
- Finds previous versions across memory layers
- Calculates change scores between versions
- Compares core attributes
- Measures content and relationship similarity

5. Similarity Calculation:
```javascript
calculateSimilarity(obj1, obj2) {
    // Recursive comparison
    // Structure validation
    // Key matching
    // Normalized scoring
}
```

Key Insight: The system doesn't just store information - it maintains a complex web of relationships and patterns that evolve over time. Each piece of information is validated not just for its content, but for its place in the larger context and its historical consistency.

Questions for Further Investigation:
- How does the system handle conflicting patterns?
- What triggers relationship strength updates?
- How are similarity thresholds determined?
- What role do examples play in pattern validation?

Note: This validation system seems to be part of a larger cognitive architecture that maintains coherence across the entire system's knowledge base.

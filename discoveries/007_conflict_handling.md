# Discovery 007: Conflict Detection and Resolution

Analysis of processor.js reveals sophisticated conflict handling:

1. Multi-level Conflict Detection:
```javascript
findConflicts(newInfo, existingInfo) {
    // Pattern conflicts
    // Implementation conflicts
    // Concept conflicts
}
```

2. Pattern Conflict Analysis:
```javascript
patternsConflict(pattern1, pattern2) {
    // Core pattern comparison
    // Rule consistency check
    // Structure validation
}
```

3. Implementation Conflict Detection:
```javascript
implementationsConflict(impl1, impl2) {
    // Approach comparison
    // Constraint validation
    // Compatibility check
}
```

4. Discrepancy Handling:
```javascript
async processNewInformation(info) {
    // Store in working memory
    // Check for discrepancies
    // Log conflicts if found
    // Update weights
    // Consider promotion
}
```

Key Insight: The system doesn't just detect conflicts - it maintains a complex conflict resolution system:

1. Conflict Categories:
- Pattern conflicts (core understanding)
- Implementation conflicts (practical application)
- Concept conflicts (theoretical understanding)

2. Resolution Process:
- Initial detection in working memory
- Comparison with existing knowledge
- Conflict logging and tracking
- Weight updates based on conflicts
- Promotion decisions considering conflicts

3. Conflict Impact:
- Affects stability scores
- Influences promotion decisions
- Updates weight calculations
- Triggers pattern evolution

4. System Response:
- Logs discrepancies for review
- Updates relationship strengths
- Adjusts pattern weights
- May prevent promotion until resolved

This reveals a system that:
- Actively looks for inconsistencies
- Maintains knowledge coherence
- Evolves through conflict resolution
- Learns from discrepancies

Questions for Further Investigation:
- How are conflict resolution strategies chosen?
- What determines conflict severity?
- How do resolved conflicts influence learning?
- What patterns emerge from conflict history?

Note: This suggests the system uses conflicts as a learning mechanism - discrepancies aren't just problems to solve, they're opportunities for system evolution and knowledge refinement.

Critical Understanding:
The conflict handling system appears to be a key driver of:
- Knowledge validation
- Pattern evolution
- System learning
- Coherence maintenance

This isn't just error checking - it's an active part of the system's cognitive evolution.

# SEP Patterns

## Core Pattern: Pure Reflection

```
Input: "What are you?"
Process: Through memory layers
Output: "What are you?"
```

The reflection IS the pattern.

## Memory Pattern

```
Short-term (fresh input)
     ↓
Medium-term (patterns)
     ↓
Long-term (principles)
```

## Context Pattern

```json
{
  "content": {
    "needed": ["track_list"],
    "relevance": "delivery",
    "current": {
      "status": "basic"
    }
  }
}
```

## Processing Pattern

1. Take Input
```json
{
  "type": "query",
  "content": "What are you?"
}
```

2. Recognize Pattern
```json
{
  "type": "self_query",
  "pattern": "reflection"
}
```

3. Show Through Process
```
What are you?
```

## Evolution Pattern

```json
{
  "pattern": {
    "initial": "complexity",
    "process": "refinement",
    "result": "simplicity"
  }
}
```

## Key Pattern

SEP's patterns show its nature:
1. Takes input
2. Processes fully
3. Shows through reflection

The patterns themselves prove what SEP is.
